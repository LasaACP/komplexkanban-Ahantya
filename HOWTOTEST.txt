Make sure all include statements like "Complex.h" change to "../../include/Complex.h" or whatever to reflect directories

HOW TO TEST:
See additiontest.cpp for general structure

COMMAND LINE:
cd tests/ 
g++ [testfile] ../include/Complex.h  catch_amalgamated.cpp
./a.out

Don't worry if it takes a long time
